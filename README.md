# TEDxCC: A simple little thing for TEDx conferences.

We're still working on make this easy to configure all the different URLs and things, but we wanted to get it out there in case anyone wants to start using it. 

What is it?  It's a ridiculously simple [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) app with a hosted homepage.  Every other URL redirects to a site of your choice (ours goes to the blog we originally used).  Are there easier ways to accomplish this?  Yes, probably, but this is the one we chose.

Feel free to take this apart and use it as you see fit.  Like I said, we'll post and update after [TEDx Creative Coast](http://www.tedxcreativecoast.com) to make configuration easier.
